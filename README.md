# Broadcast-Receivers-in-Android
This is an Android application which demonstrates Broadcast receivers in Android by registering for both System defined
and Custom Broadcasts(Intents) and receives those Broadcasts by using Intent-filter and actions and by using a subclass of 
Broadcast Receiver class and also sends a custom Broadcast by using sendBroadcast(intent).
